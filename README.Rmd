## Overview

Datasets for teaching quantitative approaches and modeling in archaeology and paleontology. This package provides several types of data related to broad topics (cultural evolution, radiocarbon dating, paleoenvironments, etc.), which can be used to illustrate statistical methods in the classroom (multivariate data analysis, compositional data analysis, diversity measurement, etc.).

This package is for teaching purposes only: some datasets may be outdated.

When using **folio**, you must cite the relevant publications for each dataset (see the documentation).

## Installation

You can install the released version of **folio** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("folio")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tesselle/folio")
```

## Usage

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
## Arnold and Libby's Curve of Knowns
## Replicate fig. 1 from Arnold and Libby (1949)
data("arnold1949")

fit <- lm(activity_found ~ age_expected, data = arnold1949)
summary(fit)

plot(
  x = arnold1949$age_expected,
  y = arnold1949$activity_found,
  type = "p",
  pch = 16,
  xlab = "Historical age (years)",
  ylab = "Specific activity (C/m/g)",
  main = "Samples of known ages"
)
segments(
  x0 = arnold1949$age_expected,
  y0 = arnold1949$activity_found - arnold1949$activity_found_error,
  x1 = arnold1949$age_expected,
  y1 = arnold1949$activity_found + arnold1949$activity_found_error
)
segments(
  x0 = arnold1949$age_expected - arnold1949$age_expected_error,
  y0 = arnold1949$activity_found,
  x1 = arnold1949$age_expected + arnold1949$age_expected_error,
  y1 = arnold1949$activity_found
)
abline(fit, col = "red")
```
